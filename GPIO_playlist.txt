# Use this file to set up specific trigger timings for the GPIO.
# The format is the on-off timing in seconds, like so:
# on,off,on,off. These will run in order in case you want to sync
# them to your sound playlist. So if you want a light to flicker
# on for .5 seconds and off for .5 seconds, you can put: 
# .5,.5,.5,.5. The minimum interval is 0.05 seconds.
